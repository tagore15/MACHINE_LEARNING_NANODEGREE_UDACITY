# UDACITY MACHINE LEARNING NANODEGREE

This is consolidated list of my projects regarding Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.   
In this Nanodegree we apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like education, finance, healthcare or robotics.   

1) Evaluating and Validating model for housing prices in Boston.    
2) Supervised learning techniques for finding models of student success in exam    
3) Unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for retail customers    
4) Creating self-driving agent learning traffic rules by reinforcement learning    
5) Identification of multiple digit number in google street view dataset (SVHN) using Deep Learning
