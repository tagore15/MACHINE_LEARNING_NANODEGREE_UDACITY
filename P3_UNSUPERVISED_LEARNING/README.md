# P3 Unsupervised Learning Projects for Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

In this project we apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. We first explore the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, we will preprocess the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, we will apply PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, we will compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
